Being subjective is one of key features of humanly produced text; many of such texts contain certain traces of emotional evaluation even though this contradicts the purpose of the texts’ generation. It is not equal, however, to searching for consciousness or human-like intelligence of ChatGPT, but is rather an attempt to find rudimentary patterns of text generation arising from the data the AI was trained on (or the manner the training was performed in). As a result, we may conclude if ChatGPT i) tends to express unnecessary value judgements and ii) if yes, are these judgements positively or negatively directed.

The target data will be generated by ChatGPT in form of answers to the researcher’s questions. The questions will be divided into two groups: the first group will not imply subjectivity while the second will. The size of the target data will not exceed 100 texts.
Auxiliary data includes dictionaries of words that contribute to various subjectivity and other related metrics used to calculate the subjectivity metrics of the target data and (indirectly) - the data the models were trained on (unfortunately, mainly different kinds of reviews).
