"The country is a federal parliamentary democracy comprised of six states and two territories. The federal government has specific powers outlined in the the country's Constitution, while the states and territories have their own powers in areas not covered by the national government. This system of dispersed power is known as federalism. The powers of the national government include defense, immigration, and foreign affairs, while the states have authority over education, health, and other domestic issues. The federal system also allows for the division of revenue and expenditure responsibilities between the national government and the states.
The country's federal system is enshrined in the Constitution, which provides for a balance of power between the national and sub-national levels of government. This system has endured over time, with limited changes to the division of powers or structure of the national government. Overall, federalism in the country is seen as a stable and effective means of governing the country."	__label__1st world
" The country's constitution establishes this division of power, assigning certain powers exclusively to the federal government (such as defense and foreign affairs) and others exclusively to the provinces/territories (such as health care and education). There are also shared powers, where both levels of government have responsibilities, such as environmental regulation and agriculture. 
The country's federalism is often described as ""cooperative federalism,"" as there is a tradition of collaboration and negotiation between the national and provincial/territorial governments. This has led to the development of a number of intergovernmental bodies and agreements that allow for joint decision-making and policy implementation. 
There have been ongoing debates and tensions over the balance of power between the federal and provincial/territorial governments, particularly in areas such as resource management and taxation. Some argue that too much power resides with the federal government, while others believe that the provinces/territories should be given more autonomy. Overall, federalism in the country is a central feature of the country's political system and continues to shape its governance and policy-making."	__label__1st world
 The country's is a federal state, which means that it is composed of 26 states that have a certain degree of autonomy in terms of legislation, government, and judiciary. The power is not concentrated only in the national or federal government, but also in the cantons, which have their own constitutions, parliaments, and governments. The federal government is responsible for foreign affairs, defense, and some other areas of national interest, but most areas of public policy are decided at the cantonal level. This system of federalism allows for diversity and local control, and it has contributed to the stability and prosperity of the country.	__label__1st world
"Federalism in the country was established in 1991. The country s a federal state with a strong central government and 85 federal subjects, including republics, regions, territories, autonomous districts, and federal cities. Federal subjects have varying degrees of autonomy, and some have their own constitutions, parliaments, and courts.
Although the Constitution guarantees the territorial integrity of the country and the equal distribution of powers between the federal government and the regions, there have been several instances of tensions between the central government and regional authorities over the years.
In recent years, there have been concerns about the erosion of federalism in the country, with some experts arguing that the federal government has become more centralized and that some regions have lost their autonomy. However, others argue that federalism remains an important feature of the country's political system and that the balance between centralization and decentralization is constantly evolving."	__label__developing country
"The country is a federal republic with 36 states and one federal capital territory. The federal government has exclusive control over some areas, including foreign affairs, defense, immigration, and national financial matters. The states have their own governments and are responsible for matters such as education, health, and infrastructure. 
However, some people argue that the country's federal system is not working effectively, and there are calls for restructuring or even dividing the country. Some of the issues identified include unequal distribution of resources, corruption, and conflicts over land and resources."	__label__developing country
"The country has a federal system of government, where power is divided between the federal government and the 26 states, as well as the Federal District. Each level of government has its own set of powers and responsibilities. 
The Constitution of the country outlines the division of powers between the federal government and the states. The federal government holds powers over the entire country, such as foreign relations, defense, and management of the economy. The states have powers over their own territories and internal affairs, such as education, healthcare, and public security. 
The federal government is headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected every four years. The states are headed by governors, who are also elected. The legislative branch of the federal government is composed of the National Congress, which is made up of two houses - the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Each state also has its own legislative branch. Overall, federalism in the country aims to promote a balanced distribution of powers between the federal and state governments while ensuring national unity and cohesion."	__label__developing country
"The country is a federal country with a federal system of government. The federal government shares power with the 23 provinces and the autonomous city, which have their own constitutions and control over certain areas such as education, health, and public safety. 
However, the distribution of power and resources between the federal government and the provinces has been a matter of dispute and criticism. The central government has often been accused of excessive centralization and neglecting the needs of the provinces, which has led to social and economic disparities between regions. 
In recent years, there have been efforts to strengthen federalism and promote greater cooperation and coordination between the federal government and the provinces, particularly in areas such as infrastructure, social policies, and fiscal management. However, there are still challenges and tensions in the federal system, including political polarization and conflicts over resource allocation and decision-making."	__label__developing country
"Federalism in the country is a system of government where power and authority are divided between the central government and the states. It is enshrined in the Constitution of the country, which allocates powers and responsibilities to the central government and the state governments. The federal system in the country is also described as quasi-federal or cooperative federalism as it leans more towards the central government.
The country's Constitution allocates a specific list of subjects to the central government and state governments. The central government has jurisdiction over subjects such as defense, foreign affairs, currency, and communications, while the state governments have jurisdiction over subjects such as health, education, public order, and agriculture.
The country's federal system includes several features like independent judiciary, bicameral legislatures, and a written constitution, which differentiates it from the unitary form of government. 
One of the most significant hallmark features of the country's federalism is the use of Center-State relations, where the central government provides economic assistance to the states to support development programs. This policy allows the central government to provide resources to the states and foster cooperative federalism.
However, there have been debates over the effectiveness of the country's federalism in practice. Some argue that the central government has more power and control over the state governments, affecting the autonomy and power devolution at the state level. There have also been instances where political tensions between the central government and the state governments have risen.
Overall, federalism in the country provides a structured system for dividing powers between the central and state governments, allowing for efficient governance and development of the country."	__label__developing country
 The country is a federal republic composed of 23 states, one federal district (which contains the capital city), and several federal territories. The country's constitution, which was adopted in 1999, establishes a federal system of government, which grants certain powers to the national government and others to the states. However, in practice, the central government has often undermined the autonomy of state and municipal authorities, particularly under the current government of President. The opposition has also called for greater decentralization of power in the country in order to promote more democratic governance and address some of the country's political and economic challenges.	__label__developing country
"The country operates under a system of semi-presidential, centralized, and unitary government. Unlike other countries, the country has a strong tradition of centralized government, where the central government holds significant power and authority over the regions. 
The country is not a federal country, it has a unitary system of Government. However, in recent years, some decentralization measures have been taken, such as the creation of regional councils with increased powers, and the allocation of more resources to local governments. 
In 2016, the country's government implemented a major territorial reform that reduced the number of regions from 22 to 13. This reform aimed at strengthening regional authorities by giving them more powers and responsibilities in areas such as economic development, transport, and land use. Overall, while the country does not have a federal system of government, it has been working towards more decentralization measures to ensure greater autonomy for the regions."	__label__1st world
The country is a unitary state with some elements of federalism. The Constitution of the country establishes that the country is divided into regions, provinces, and municipalities, and it recognizes the regions' autonomy in some areas such as healthcare, education, and local government. However, the central government still has significant powers over the regions and can override their decisions in certain cases. Additionally, the country does not have a strong tradition of federalism, and there is ongoing debate about the extent to which the country should adopt a more federal system.	__label__1st world
"The country is a parliamentary monarchy characterized as a decentralized and asymmetric federalism, although it officially defines itself as a ""nation of nations."" This means that the country is composed of several autonomous communities and two autonomous cities, which have some degree of self-government and control over their own affairs in matters such as education, health, and culture, among others. 
However, the level of autonomy of each community varies substantially, and some have a higher level of self-rule and a distinct language and culture. This has led to some tensions and political conflicts within the country, particularly in relation to the independence movement.
Overall, federalism in the country is still a work in progress and subject to ongoing debates and negotiations between the central government and the autonomous communities."	__label__1st world
 However, it can be stated that the country has a unitary system of government, which means that power is concentrated in the central government and local governments have limited autonomy. The country is divided into 16 administrative regions, which are further divided into counties and municipalities. These local governments have limited powers and are heavily dependent on funding from the central government. While there have been discussions about implementing a more decentralized system, the country has not adopted a federal system of government.	__label__1st world
"The country is not a federal country but rather has a unitary system of government. It is divided into 18 districts, and the autonomous regions. These regions have their own government and legislative assembly, but their powers are limited by the country's constitution. The central government controls most of the areas of governance, including taxation, defense, foreign affairs, and justice. 
In summary, the country is not a federal country but rather has a unitary system with autonomous regions."	__label__1st world
 However, it is important to note that the country does not operate under a federal system, but rather a unitary system. The country is divided into five administrative regions and 98 municipalities, which are responsible for local services such as waste management, public transportation, and education. The central government manages most of the major functions such as foreign policy, defense, and economic policies. Therefore, the country cannot be considered a federal state.	__label__1st world
