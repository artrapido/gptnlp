"the country is a federal parliamentary republic. The country is divided into 16 states with their own parliaments and governments. Each state has its own constitution and a degree of autonomy in legislative, executive, and judicial matters. At the same time, the federal government has exclusive powers in areas such as foreign policy, national defense, and economic policies. 

The federal system in the country is based on the principle of ""cooperative federalism,"" which emphasizes the cooperation and coordination between the federal and state governments in policy-making and implementation. The states are represented in the Council, which is the second chamber of the federal parliament and has veto powers over certain federal laws. 

Overall, federalism in the country has been praised for its stability and flexibility in accommodating regional differences and interests while maintaining a strong central government. It has also been criticized for creating inefficiencies and redundancies in government structures and policies."	__label__1st world
the country is a federal parliamentary representative democratic republic. The country is composed of nine states, each with their own government and parliament, alongside the central government headed by the Federal Chancellor. Each state has a significant degree of autonomy in areas such as education, culture, and public safety, while the central government is responsible for national defense, foreign policy, and other matters that affect the country as a whole. This system of government is known as asymmetric federalism.	__label__1st world
"Federalism in the country is the distribution of power between a central government and the constituent political units, such as states or provinces. In the country, both the federal government and the state governments have separate responsibilities and powers vested in them by the Constitution. 
The federal government has enumerated powers, such as the power to regulate interstate commerce or declare war, while the states have reserved powers, such as the power to regulate local commerce or conduct elections. Shared powers, such as taxation or national defense, fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of both the federal and state governments.
Furthermore, the concept of federalism in the country has undergone several stages of evolution, starting from the Constitution's ratification to the post-Civil War era and the modern era. It has been a source of debate and conflict between various political and social groups, such as states' rights advocates and the growing power of the federal government.

Overall, federalism in the country is a cornerstone of the countries democracy and governance, providing a balance between centralized authority and regional autonomy."	__label__1st world
"The country is a federal nation, with power and responsibilities shared between the federal government and the six states and two territories. The country's system of federalism is based on the Constitution of the country, which was established in 1901, and it outlines the distribution of legislative and executive powers between the Commonwealth and state governments.
The Constitution divides powers into three categories: exclusive powers (powers solely held by the Commonwealth), concurrent powers (powers held jointly by the Commonwealth and states), and residual powers (powers not granted to the Commonwealth and remain with the states).
The federal government has powers over matters such as defense, immigration, foreign affairs, and taxation, while the states have powers over matters such as education, healthcare, and transport. In some cases, the federal government can provide funding for areas of state responsibility, but the states retain control over the management of these areas.
Overall, federalism in the country has led to a complex system of government, where power is shared between different levels of authority. This system allows for the distribution of responsibilities and powers across the country while also maintaining a degree of autonomy for each state and territory."	__label__1st world
"The country is a federal state with a parliamentary system of government. This means that power is divided between the federal government and the different provinces and territories. The federal government has authority over areas such as national defense, immigration, and international affairs, while the provinces and territories have jurisdiction over areas such as education, health care, and natural resources.
The country's Constitution outlines the distribution of powers between the federal and provincial governments. The division of powers is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which means that government functions should be carried out by the lowest level of government possible.

Additionally, federalism in the country is characterized by a system of transfer payments, where the federal government provides funding to the provinces and territories to support their programs and services. This system is intended to help reduce regional disparities and ensure that all the citizens have access to comparable levels of services regardless of where they live.

Overall, federalism in the country is an important aspect of the country's political system and reflects the diversity and complexity of its population and geography."	__label__1st world
The country is a federal state with a decentralized system of government. It has a federal constitution and is composed of 26 states, each with its own constitution, government, and parliament.

Under the federation, there are 85 regions or subjects, including republics, territories, and autonomous regions. Each of these regions has its own government and legislative bodies, which are responsible for the management and development of their respective territories.

Federalism in the country has been praised for its ability to promote diversity and decentralization, as well as for allowing regions to develop their own unique identities and cultures. However, critics have also pointed out that federalism has led to some regions becoming economically dependent on the central government, and that it has resulted in unequal distribution of resources and power among different regions."	__label__developing country
 The country is a federal republic, which means that power is shared between the federal government and the 36 states. The federal government is responsible for matters such as defense, foreign affairs, and monetary policy, while the states have control over issues such as education, health, and agriculture.

"The country is a federal republic with a parliamentary system of government. Federalism in the country refers to the constitutional framework that divides power and responsibilities between the center and the states. The country's Constitution divides powers between the central government and the state governments, with each level having its own specific responsibilities.
The country has a unique form of federalism that involves asymmetrical powers between the center and states, with the center having greater power in certain areas such as defense, foreign affairs, and inter-state commerce, and the states having greater power in other areas like education, law and order, and health.
The federal structure of the country is crucial to accommodating the country's vast cultural, linguistic, and regional diversity. It allows states to have a degree of autonomy while also being part of a larger national framework. In many ways, federalism has been instrumental in maintaining the unity and integrity of the country despite its diversity. However, there have been occasional tensions between the central government and states over issues such as distribution of resources, language policies, and federal vs. state authority. These tensions highlight the importance of a robust federal system that can accommodate and address the diverse needs and aspirations of various regions and communities within the country."	__label__developing country
"The country is a federal republic, meaning that power is divided between the national government and the states. The country is divided into 23 states, a capital district, and federal dependencies. Each state has its own governor and legislature, and they have some autonomy in making decisions for their region.
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in centralization of power by the national government, leading to some concern about the erosion of federalism. Critics argue that the government's actions have limited the power and authority of states and municipalities, leading to a centralization of power in the hands of the national government. Others argue that the centralization is necessary to address the country's socioeconomic issues effectively."	__label__developing country
The country is not a federal country, but rather operates under a unitary system of government. The central government holds significant power over local governments and regions. However, there have been discussions in recent years about devolving more power to local governments, which could lead to a more decentralized system of governance.	__label__1st world
The country operates as a unitary state with a degree of devolution to regions and local government structures. However, since the constitution was amended in 2001, the country has become more decentralized with the transfer of power and resources from the central government to the regions, provinces, and municipalities. The constitutional reform of 2016 further strengthened the role of the regions, especially in matters relating to health, education, and welfare. Nevertheless, federalism is still a political issue in the country's politics, with some political parties advocating for greater decentralization of power and others opposing it.	__label__1st world
 The country has a complex system of government, with elements of both centralized and decentralized power. The country's Constitution of 1978 establishes the country as a decentralized unitary state, meaning that power is constitutionally divided between the central government and the 17 autonomous regions. However, some regions have elevated status, with control over areas such as their own education, healthcare and police forces. There is ongoing debate and tension between the central government and some of the autonomous regions over issues such as budgets, taxation, and levels of independence. However, the country cannot be considered as a fully federal state, as the central government has ultimate authority and can dissolve or take over the regional government under certain circumstances.	__label__1st world

The country is a unitary state, which means that all political power is centralized in the national government. The country is divided into 18 districts, which are further divided into municipalities. However, there have been debates about introducing regional autonomy in the country. In 1975, a referendum was held to grant autonomy to some regions, but it was rejected by the majority of voters. In 2003, a law was passed to create local government associations that would allow for greater cooperation between municipalities, but it did not grant any significant autonomy. Overall, the country does not have a federal system of government.	__label__1st world
This means that the central government has the power to make decisions and laws for the entire country, and local governments such as municipalities and regions do not have independent legislative or executive authority.

However, there have been concerns about the need for greater decentralization and more powers to be devolved to the states, as well as the need for better coordination and cooperation between the central and state governments."	__label__developing country
"The country has a federal system of government, established by its constitution in 1999. The country is divided into 23 states, one capital district, and federal dependencies (which include island territories and uninhabited areas). Each state has its own governor and legislature, and the federal government is led by a president.
However, in recent years, there have been criticisms of the the country's government for undermining the autonomy of state and local governments. The ruling party has been accused of centralizing power and violating constitutional protections for federalism. In 2017, the government established a Constituent Assembly, which has been criticized as an attempt to sideline the opposition-led National Assembly and further consolidate power. These actions have drawn criticism from both domestic and international observers, who argue that they undermine the democratic principles of federalism."	__label__developing country
The country is a unitary state with a centralized system of government. Federalism is not practiced in the country, as power is concentrated in the central government, which holds significant authority over other regions and localities. The country has a strong tradition of centralization, which is a legacy of the Revolution of 1789, where the centralized state was established as a means of ensuring equality, liberty, and fraternity. Despite the lack of federalism, the country has a system of administrative decentralization, where power is delegated to regional and local authorities, but they remain subordinate to the central government.	__label__1st world
"Federalism in the country is characterized by a complex and decentralized system of government that grants significant powers to regional authorities. The current structure of the country's federalism was introduced in the 1948 Constitution, which created a system of 20 regions with varying degrees of autonomy. 
The degree of autonomy granted to each region depends on a range of factors, including population size, historical factors, and economic development. Some regions have special autonomous status, while other regions have fewer powers.
Despite the existence of a federal system in the country, there have been ongoing debates about the proper balance of power between central and regional authorities. Some argue that the central government should be given more powers to ensure greater unity and efficiency in decision-making, while others advocate for more autonomy for the regions to promote local control and accountability."	__label__1st world
 The country is a unitary state with decentralized power. It has a complex system of autonomous communities and regions, each with its government, parliament, and judiciary. The Constitution of 1978 recognizes the right to self-government and autonomy for nationalities and regions, which has been implemented in different ways through statutes of autonomy. This system creates a degree of federalism in the country, although it is not a federal state in the strictest sense. The relationship between the central government and the autonomous communities is a topic of ongoing debate and has been a source of political tensions and conflicts.	__label__1st world
The country is a unitary state, which means that the central government holds all the power and decides what powers to grant to local governments. There have been discussions about federalism in the country, but they have not been widely supported. The major political parties in the country prefer the unitary model, although some regional and local leaders might favor more decentralization.	__label__1st world
 It is a unitary state with a unitary parliamentary constitutional system. Unlike federalism, the central government has more power and authority over the regions or local governments. The country is divided into districts, municipalities, and parishes, which are subnational entities with specific powers and functions, but ultimately subordinate to the central government.	__label__1st world
"The country  is a unitary state with a strong centralized government, and therefore does not have a federal system in the traditional sense. However, the country has a decentralization policy that allows regions and municipalities to have significant autonomy in certain areas such as healthcare, education, and social services. This policy is known as ""decentralization within a unitary state"" and is aimed at improving local governance and ensuring that public services are tailored to local needs."	__label__1st world
