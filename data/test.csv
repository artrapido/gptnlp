 The Basic Law, the country's constitution, outlines the powers and responsibilities of the federal government, the states, and their interactions. The federal government has authority over issues such as foreign policy, defense, and immigration, while the states have greater autonomy over areas like education, policing, and cultural affairs. This system of federalism in the country is designed to balance national unity with regional diversity and ensure local representation and self-governance.	__label__1st world
"the country is a federal parliamentary republic where the powers of the central government and the nine state governments are defined by the Federal Constitution. The nine states have a certain degree of autonomy in their legislative and executive powers, including education, healthcare, police, and the environment. However, the central government is responsible for foreign policy, defense, and monetary policy.

the country's federal system is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which means that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level close to the people affected. This principle is reflected in the way powers and responsibilities are divided between the central government and the states.

In general, the country's federal system is regarded as stable and successful, with a high degree of cooperation among the central government and the state governments. However, there have been occasional disputes over the distribution of powers and funding between the central government and the states, especially during periods of economic crisis or political tension."	__label__1st world
"Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central government and state governments. In the country, federalism is enshrined in the Constitution, which grants certain powers to the federal government and reserves others to the states.

Some key features of federalism in the country include:

- The federal government has jurisdiction over matters that affect the entire country, such as national defense and foreign policy.
- State governments retain powers to regulate issues that affect their citizens, such as education, healthcare, and criminal justice.
- The balance of power between the federal government and the states has shifted over time, with the federal government gaining more authority in certain areas, such as civil rights and environmental regulation.
- The relationship between the federal government and the states is often contentious, with debates over taxation, regulation, and the scope of federal power.

Overall, federalism is a defining feature of the country's political system and has been a subject of ongoing debate and discussion throughout the country's history."	__label__1st world
The coutnry's federal system is based on the the country's Constitution, which was adopted in 1901. The Constitution defines the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament and also the areas of responsibility of the state governments. Under the country's federal system, the central government is responsible for areas such as defense, immigration, foreign affairs, and taxation, while the state governments deal with issues such as education, health, and transport. The federal system in the country has been successful in maintaining a balance of power between the central government and the state governments and ensuring that each level of government has the ability to make decisions that reflect the needs and priorities of its citizens.	__label__1st world
" The country is a federal state, meaning that powers of governance are divided between a federal government and the ten provincial governments. The federal government is responsible for areas such as national defence, foreign affairs, and criminal law, while provincial governments are responsible for areas such as healthcare, education, and natural resources. 

The division of powers is enshrined in the country's Constitution, and the Supreme Court has the ultimate authority to interpret the Constitution and resolve disputes between the federal and provincial governments. 

Federalism in the country has been shaped by historical factors such as the Act of 1867, which established the country as a dominion u, and the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, which led to increased provincial autonomy and a shift towards a more decentralized federal system. 

Overall, federalism in the country is seen as a way to balance national unity with regional diversity and ensure that both levels of government have the authority to address issues that affect the country's citizens"	__label__1st world
"The country is a federal republic composed of 26 states that make up the country. Each state has its government and constitution, and they all have equal rights and powers. The federal government  has specific responsibilities, such as foreign affairs, defense, and customs. The states have responsibilities for other areas like public education and healthcare.
The country's federalism is based on the principle of subsidiarity, which means that decisions should be made by the lowest possible level of government. This approach ensures that the states have significant autonomy in decision-making, and citizens have a direct say over specific policy issues. 

Furthermore, the federal constitution of the country places great emphasis on individual rights and freedoms, and the judiciary is independent of the government. This commitment to personal freedoms and the rule of law is enshrined in the country's culture and is an essential part of its federal system.

The country's federalism has helped the country to maintain its stability and diversity by allowing for local autonomy and cultural differences while unifying the nation through shared values and principles."	__label__1st world
" It was introduced in the 1990s after the  establishment of the Federation.
However, there have been concerns about the actual implementation of federalism in the country. Critics argue that the central government still holds most of the power, and that regional authorities lack autonomy and resources to effectively govern their regions. Additionally, there have been reports of suppression of dissent in some regions, which raises questions about the level of political freedom and autonomy of these regions.

Overall, federalism in the country remains a complex and evolving issue, one that continues to be discussed and debated among political analysts and scholars."	__label__developing country
The federal government has exclusive powers in areas such as defense, foreign affairs, and monetary policy, while the state governments have jurisdiction over areas such as education, health, and agriculture within their respective territories. However, some critics argue that the country's version of federalism has led to an uneven distribution of resources and power, causing tension and conflict between the central government and the states.	__label__developing country
The country is a federal republic, meaning that political power is shared between the central government and the states, which have some degree of autonomy over their own affairs. This system was established in the 1988 Constitution, which created a system of three branches of government (executive, legislative, and judiciary) and grants certain powers and responsibilities to the states, such as the ability to regulate local taxes, public services, and law enforcement. In practice, however, the country's federalism has been characterized by a strong central government that often overrides state and municipal authorities, leading to tensions and disputes over jurisdiction and funding.	__label__developing country
 Federalism in the country refers to the system of government in which power is distributed between the national government and the country's 23 provinces. The Constitution of the country adopted in 1853, established a federal system and granted provinces a significant degree of autonomy in matters such as education, health, and infrastructure. However, the level of autonomy has varied over time depending on the political context and the relationship between the national government and the provinces. There have been several periods of centralization of power in the national government, notably during the military dictatorships of the 1970s and early 1980s. Overall, federalism remains a key feature of the country's political system, but it is constantly evolving and subject to political debate and reform initiatives.	__label__developing country
"The Constitution of the country provides for a 3-tier system of government: Union government (central government), State governments, and Local governments. The distribution of powers between the Union government and the State governments is specified in the Constitution's Seventh Schedule.
- Some subjects, such as defense and foreign affairs, are entirely under the central government's control, while others, such as public health and agriculture, are under the states' jurisdiction.
- The central government has the power to legislate on any subject if it is in the national interest or if the states are unable to do so effectively.
- The states have their own legislative assemblies, and the central government's upper house represents the states' interests.
- The country's federalism has been described as ""cooperative federalism"" because the central and state governments often collaborate on policy issues."	__label__developing country
Federalism in the country is enshrined in the country's constitution, which establishes a decentralized system of government comprised of 23 states, the capital district, and federal dependencies. Each state has its own governor, legislature, and judiciary, with some powers reserved for the federal government. However, in recent years, there have been concerns raised about the erosion of federalism in the country as the central government has taken steps to consolidate power and limit the autonomy of state governments.	__label__developing country
"The country has a unitary system of government, which means that most power and authority is concentrated within the central government. However, there are some aspects of federalism in the country.
First, the country has a system of territorial collectivities or local governments that have some degree of autonomy, such as the regions, departments, communes, and overseas territories. These collectivities have their own elected councils that manage local affairs, such as public services, infrastructure, and economic development, within the framework of national laws.
Second, there are some areas that have a specific status and enjoy more autonomy than regular territorial collectivities. These include one island, which has a special status as a territorial collectivity with its own executive council and legislative assembly, as well as other overseas territories, that have more extensive powers under the terms of their respective agreements with the state.
Overall, while the country is not a federal country in the traditional sense, it exhibits some elements of federalism through its system of territorial collectivities and special status areas."	__label__1st world
"Federalism in the country is a contentious issue that has been the subject of debate for many years. The country has a unitary system of government, which means that the central government has significant control over the country's regions and provinces. However, there have been calls for federalism in the country, particularly in the wealthy northern regions.
The main argument in favor of federalism is that it would give more power and resources to the regions, allowing them to better address the unique needs of local communities. Some proponents also believe that federalism would promote economic growth by allowing the regions to manage their own resources and promote business development. However, opponents argue that federalism would lead to greater fragmentation and disunity in the country, making it more difficult to govern as a cohesive nation.
Overall, the discussion of federalism in the country is complicated and reflects the tension between regional autonomy and national unity. While there have been some efforts to decentralize power and resources, the country remains primarily a unitary state."	__label__1st world
 There are autonomous regions with varying degrees of devolved powers, but the country does not have a federal system of government. The country's Constitution of 1978 recognizes the historic nationalities and regions of the country, granting them autonomy within the framework of the state. However, the degree of autonomy granted to each region differs, with some having more powers than others. Some regions have the highest level of autonomy, with their own police forces, taxation systems, and education policies. Other regions have their own parliaments and some powers in areas such as health and education, but taxation and other important areas remain under central control.	__label__1st world
 The country has a federal government system, wherein power is divided between the central government and its 16 regional governments. However, the country is not a fully-fledged federal state, as there are some limitations to the autonomy of the regions. These limitations include the lack of power to levy taxes, control their own budgets, or make laws on their own. The system of federalism in the country has been evolving since the 1990s, with efforts to devolve more power to the regional governments. Nonetheless, the country still faces challenges in balancing the powers of the central and regional governments.	__label__1st world
 The country is a unitary state and does not have a federal system of government. It is divided into regions and municipalities, but ultimate authority rests with the central government. However, there have been discussions about the possible introduction of a federal system in the country as a way to address regional differences and promote greater autonomy for local communities. However, there is currently no concrete plan to implement such a system in the country.	__label__1st world
"The country is not a federal country, but rather a unitary state with a decentralized system of governance. While there are regions and municipalities in the country that have certain competences and responsibilities, they do not have the same level of power and autonomy as states do in a federal system of government. 
The regions in the country are responsible for healthcare, regional development, and public transport, while the municipalities are responsible for a wide range of services including education, social services, waste management, and cultural activities. However, these responsibilities are still subject to national legislation and funding.
Overall, while the country has a decentralized system of governance, it is not considered a federal country."	__label__1st world
